# Activity 1 - Student Bio Page

* On your own, create a simple bio page for yourself using the following HTML elements...

  * A header that will store your name inside of it
  * An image that will act as a stand-in for your picture with an `alt` attribute which gives a very basic description of the image
  * Two paragraphs that will have text describing who you are
  * An unordered list of links that connect to your social media pages
  * A table that will contain three columns and some data on your favorite movies, songs, books, or activities

### Hints

* Dummy images can be found at [lorempixel.com](http://lorempixel.com/) and dummy text can be found at [lipsum.com](http://www.lipsum.com/). Focus on getting the entire page working before diving into more specific text and images.

### Bonuses

* Look into how one might go about linking one custom-made HTML page to another. Once you have found out how, try creating a link from your bio page you have just created to one of the pages you created last class.
